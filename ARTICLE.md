## What I Found Interesting
I find this article interesting because LLMs affect almost every aspect of the software engineering industry today. In my opinion, if you are working at a big tech company and are not using an LLM to speed up your work, then you're behind a lot of other engineers. And I think the same can be said about college; if you're not asking LLMs to help understand and guide you in your coursework, then you're at a disadvantage. Of course, I do not condone using LLMs to complete your work, but there are things that LLMs are useful for, such as searching up something in a textbook, which could otherwise take hours. But I do agree with the fact that overusing LLMs is a dangerous thing because then it makes you easily replaceable, as an engineer. I think there needs to be a balance between how much you are using LLMs versus how much you abstain.

## Added Thoughts
Arjun Iyer - I also agree on the necessity of using LLMs as a tool instead of completely relying on them. But additionally, it seems very clear that a LLM can do majority of the job of sofware engineers so we need to have a larger skillset
